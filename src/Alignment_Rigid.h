// point cloud, PCA is performed separately on the reference and moving point clouds, distribution moments along
// each axis are computed to determine the direction, and then rotates the moving point cloud so the principle axes
// coincide.
//
// This algorithm will eagerly produce mirror transformations, so is best suited for dense, non-symmetric point sets.
//
// Note that this routine only identifies a suitable transform, it does not implement it by altering the inputs.

// Special logic is provided to handle low-dimensional degeneracies, but it is recommended to not rely on it.

// avoid cases with low-dimensional degeneracies.
