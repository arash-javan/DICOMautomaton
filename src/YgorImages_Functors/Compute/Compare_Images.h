    // If no interpolation is selected, the agreement position will only be established to
    // within approximately the reference image voxels dimensions. To avoid interpolation, voxels that straddle the
    // target value are taken as the agreement distance. Conceptually, if you view a voxel as having a finite spatial
    // extent then this method may be sufficient for distance assessment. Though it is not precise, it is fast. 
    // This method will tend to over-estimate the actual distance, though it is possible that it slightly
    // under-estimates it. This method works best when the reference image grid size is small in comparison to the
    // desired spatial accuracy (e.g., if computing gamma, the tolerance should be much larger than the largest voxel
    // dimension) so supersampling is recommended.
    //
    // Nearest-neighbour interpolation considers the line connecting directly adjacent voxels. Using linear
    // interpolation along this line when adjacent voxels straddle the target value, the 3D point where the target value
    // appears can be predicted. This method can significantly improve distance estimation accuracy, though will
    // typically be much slower than no interpolation. On the other hand, this method lower amounts of supersampling,
    // though it is most reliable when the reference image grid size is small in comparison to the desired spatial
    // accuracy. Note that nearest-neighbour interpolation also makes use of the 'no interpolation' methods.
    //
    // Finally, next-nearest-neighbour considers the diagonally-adjacent neighbours separated by taxi-cab distance of 2
    // (so in-plane diagonals are considered, but 3D diagonals are not). Quadratic (i.e., bi-linear) interpolation is
    // analytically solved to determine where along the straddling diagonal the target value appears. This method is
    // more expensive than linear interpolation but will generally result in more accurate distance estimates. This
    // method may require lower amounts of supersampling than linear interpolation, but is most reliable when the
    // reference image grid size is small in comparison to the desired spatial accuracy. Use of this method may not be
    // appropriate in all cases considering that supersampling may be needed and a quadratic equation is solved for
